h1. SIPATRA

Sipatra is a simple Sinatra like DSL for SIP Servlets. It's heavily inspired from Sinatra and was adapted only in those areas that were required by differences between the HTTP and SIP protocols.

h2. Handlers

In Sipatra an handler is a SIP method paired with an URI matching pattern and some conditions. Each handler is associated with a block:

<pre>
invite 'sip:standard@.*' do
    proxy "sip:0123456789@#{request.getRequestURI.getHost}"
end

register do
    proxy
end
</pre>
